My blogging has been on the back burner for a while. Anyway, I am back and will hopefully
do it a bit more often. Here is something youtube suggested. Looks like a game of <a href="https://louiscordier.com/the_3_book_of_louis/#game-of-colors" target="_blank">Red vs Blue, AI style</a>.

Since the topic is AI, I would like to give a shout-out to my friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EddieDunckley" target="_blank">Eddie and his AI assisted music</a>.

I have started a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/louiscordier" target="_blank">patreon</a> page and would
like to offer subscribers the opportunity to <a href="https://x.com/lcordier_x" target="_blank">ask questions</a> for future blog posts.
