# Taxi Recapitalisation Programme

A shout out to my friend Johan van Wyk of Bloemendal Restaurant fame.

Years back we put in effort to develop a circuit radio for TRP, only to be skrewed by infighting between
Taxis, Golden Arrow and Metrorail.

I found a more eloquent solution.

Spec upgrade:
1. https://www.trysome.co.za/product-details/muirhead-rev-and-speed-limiter
2. https://protectacar.co.za/the-5-best-sound-systems-in-south-africa-right-now/ (the passengers need good sound)
3. Some decent BTU aircon
4. All money goes to the driving team, driver-operators. (a lot like small scale fisheries).
5. People can invest into a Taxi, but no bleeding of resources.

“We had thousands of years of wanting to get from A to B in the most expedient way possible. But now we can get between places incredibly efficiently, and people have realised that they go from A to B to C to D to E to F to G to retirement to death, without actually noticing what they’re doing at those points at all.” - Tristan Gooley
